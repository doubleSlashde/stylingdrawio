# doubleSlash draw.io styles

This repository contains the doubleSlash styling libraries used in draw.io. They are integrated in confluence and maintained by the CoC-Group AMSD. The  files can also be downloaded and used on the desktop client.

## Customization

A guideline how to customize the configuration can be found in the [draw.io docs](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/configure-diagram-editor). A collection of shared libraries and a tutorial on how to create a custom library can be found in the drawio GitHub repository [drawio-libs](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-libs).

### Make your own shapes and libraries

Use the following information to create your own shapes, styles and custom libraries.

* [Create a new custom shape library](https://www.drawio.com/blog/custom-libraries.html), add shapes, and export it as an `.xml` file to share it with others.
* [Create and edit your own custom shapes](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/custom-shapes.html) by describing their geometry and style. You can create [complex custom shapes](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/shape-complex-create-edit.html) that include embedded links and images.
* [Style your custom shape](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/shape-styles.html) after adding it to the drawing canvas and add the styled shape to your custom library.
* [Customize the connection points on any shape](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/shape-connection-points-customise.html) on the drawing canvas with our visual editor to make sure connectors attach to logical positions. Add this modified shape to your custom library.

## Usage

### Global config

The global config can be used as described here: [Configure the draw.io editor](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/configure-diagram-editor).

### Libs

The libraries and global configuration can be used both in confluence as well as in the desctop app. For reference see https://www.drawio.com/blog/configure-template-library

When directly referencing a configuration from GitHub, use the RAW URL of the library which is of the form https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ORG/REPO/REF/PATH/FILENAME.xml, eg. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgraph/drawio-libs/master/libs/templates.xml
